What you may not be aware of is the fact that there are certain refineries that have been producing items with substantially, even dangerously, less purity than they claim. Whether it is due to ineptitude, hubris, or greed is not something that we care to comment upon.</i></p><p><i>We are pleased to report that all of the samples obtained from your refinery have passed our tests. In order to compensate you for any inconvenience, and to encourage you to continue following the carefully crafted processes, we are awarding you {{swayAmount1}} SWAY.</i></p><p><i>Kind Regards,</i></p><p><i>The Adalian Institute of Technology</i>\"</p><p>That is a nice, unexpected bonus for today, even if it comes with some concerning news about the outputs of other refineries.</p>",
