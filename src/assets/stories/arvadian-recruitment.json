Built with all of our hard-won knowledge about sustainability- knowledge acquired too late to save Earth- they would deliver a tiny fraction of humanity to their new home: a promising exoplanet orbiting a nearby star.\n\nYour ancestors were fortunate enough to earn a place on one of those ships.",

These would presumably have large moon systems around each of them, but that would be a detail too minor to see until they drew closer.\n\nThey also had already found the small rocky planet that had been hinted at by its minor gravitational effects on more massive planets. They could see that it had a thick atmosphere from the soft fuzziness of its outline in the ship's largest telescope, but hadn't yet determined its composition.\n\nBetween this small rocky planet and the huge gas giant, they could see a dense asteroid belt covering what would have been the \"Goldilocks Zone\" of the system if only a planet had been orbiting there.\n\nEventually, they also found a fifth planet: a tiny hot rock smaller than Mercury and orbiting very close to the star Adalia.\n\nAnd that was it. That was what there was to work with here.\n\nThe planets were first assigned letters, A through E, by their distance from the star. These letters were quickly expanded into names.",

The event is informative, if somewhat dry and academic, but it is short on conclusions and doesn't really resolve the uncertainty that has slowly spread across the ship. It runs long and sort of trails off toward the end.\n\nAfter the event is over, you and the other attendees step out of the Amphitheater to find the hall outside occupied by a massive crowd. A dozen or so public speakers are shouting into the crowd, each championing different courses of action from improvised stages as diverse as the speakers themselves.\n\nYou come out of the Council presentation even more confused than you were before you attended. What does the Council expect you to do with this detailed information about how terrible all these planets are? How are you supposed to use this information to decide between them?\n\nComing down the stairs into a dense crowd of barkers and marks only makes this feeling worse. If the Council couldn't make things clear with a lengthy presentation by subject matter experts, how is a mob being shouted at by crazy people going to help?\n\nYou see one particular barker that has attracted a sizable crowd based largely on spectacle: he is shirtless and bright red with a fresh sunburn, standing below a large square banner of a golden cartoon sun with the letters \"RA\" inside it. You imagine him sitting on one of the ship's tanning beds for many hours to get to this state.\n\n\"The Chief Archivist thinks that she can dismiss us by comparing us to the \"Ra Boys\" from some ancient sci-fi book that only she has ever heard of, but the joke's on her because that sounds rad as hell!\" he is shouting at the crowd around him. \"Think about it: shit was good on Earth under the loving rays of Ra, and then as soon as we leave and Ra grows tiny and faint behind us, what happens? Boom! Knocked off course!\" He nods gravely, as if this alone is convincing. \"And now that we are finally across the Ra-cursed Void and can see a sun again, shit's about to get rad again! We're gonna build a huge glass dome on Aion and soak in Ra's loving light again. Aion is the obvious choice, but unlike those panicking \"Moths\" that are just drawn to the light ‘cause they think it's only good for solar panels, we are going to get tanned as hell, fight all the Moths, steal their girls, and make a bunch of little Ra Boys, if you know what I mean!\"\n\nYou keep moving through the crowd away from him, but you think he might be onto something. Not the whole \"Ra\" thing; that's insane. But the Moths thing. Aion is the obvious answer, and the Arvad is covered in a forest of photovoltaic panels that will work even better on the airless surface of Aion. No one is shouting this position at a crowd, but that only makes it more compelling to you. There must be other Moths out there that you could work with.\n\nAnd once all the Ra Boys die from exposure, it will be perfect.",

No nonsense, no radical changes. Just doing what is necessary.\"\n\nIn the relative silence as her audience nods along to this very reasonable idea, you hear someone behind you shrieking about taking someone else's threads, and a moment later, another voice calls out, \"trying to keep everyone alive can and will only end up with everyone dead!\"\n\nYou wonder if so reasonable and straightforward an idea as the Necessity Colony can survive in the frantic discourse of the moment.",

Many of them seem very interested in the two inner planets, which seems crazy to you since you have just come from the official presentation that went over how unsuitable they were in rather explicit detail. A few other groups are focused on the largest moon of Chronos, but you are a little freaked out about living so close to a massive gas giant.\n\nWhich is how you come to be walking slowly past a man dressed in a Reactor Technician uniform, who you realize is proposing something else entirely.\n\n\"We already know that we can live in the Interstellar Void just fine; we've been doing it for more than a century at this point. Living on a hot planet close to the sun - airless or with a poisonous atmosphere - is something that we are simply not prepared for.\n\n\"The only thing that we really need is more fuel for the reactors. If we had that, we would be set. Either one of the two outer planets' moon systems would work. We wouldn't get much stellar energy out that far, but we haven't had that available to us for this whole voyage before this point. We don't need it, and it only creates more of a problem out of waste heat. We heat with our reactor exactly like we have been doing, and our heat radiators just keep cooling us down exactly like they were designed to.\"\n\n\"Why not Ananke, the moon of Chronos?\" someone asks. \"Why just the two outer planets?\"\n\n\"Too deep in a gravity well,\" he answers. \"Too hard to move around that close to such a huge mass.\"",

Living on a hot planet close to the sun - airless or with a poisonous atmosphere - is something that we are simply not prepared for.\n\n\"The only thing that we really need is more fuel for the reactors.

And there, behind someone in the flashy jacket of a pilot, is a banner like no other.\n\nSomeone has taken one of the bodyboards from the swim deck of the Arvad…and just stuck it to the wall in here. What’s that about, you wonder, moving closer.\n\nAs you approach it, you see that it has the words \"Toxic Sea Surfers\" painted on it. The pilot points at it dramatically, working the crowd up.\n\n\"Yeah, you like that? Pretty cool, right? Humans need a planet. Humans need water! I mean, the planet’s not great, sure, and I don’t think the water is, like, technically water, exactly. It’ll probably kill us. Maybe instantly, maybe a bit slower. I don’t know; I’m not a chemist. There might not even be waves on those seas. Or maybe there are really awesome waves! We just don’t know! So maybe, we could, like, go down there and see? Or something. I don’t know!\"\n\nHe stops talking for a moment and looks around at his audience like he’s searching for something.\n\n\"I mean, I really don’t know, honestly,\" he continues. \"This all looked really cool, so I just ran down to the pool and stole a little surfboard thing. I actually have no idea what I’m doing. I’m not even a pilot! I just stole this jacket from the locker room on the way back.\"\n\nHe looks around again. \"So, uh, yeah…vote Toxic Sea Surfers, dudes!\"",

He has a red beard and a mohawk, with the sides of his head cropped extremely short, pilot style.\n\n\"The Commander doesn’t have a plan!\" he insists. \"The Council doesn’t have a plan. They came here expecting a habitable planet, and now that there isn’t one they are all out of ideas. They have nothing!\"\n\nHe pauses for effect, and the crowd fills the gap with shouts and cheers. When they start to settle down again, he leans in slightly and speaks in a clear stage whisper.\n\n\"They have nothing,\" he repeats, \"and it is time to get rid of them and replace them with something new.\" He starts to stand taller and speak louder. \"Our arrival here in Adalia is a disaster. This is an emergency. We need a new Council. Immediately. A decisive Council, charged with solving this problem and granted the power to do so.\"\n\nHe throws his arms out dramatically to emphasise his point. \"An Emergency Powers Council!\"",

    "content": "In the two weeks following the inconclusive Prime Council presentation and the chaos in the great hall outside the Amphitheater, there has been an abundance of very lively discussion on the Arvad ship network.\n\nDebate still rages on where to go and what to do next. Some of the more fringe factions have faded away and their supporters have merged with factions with more staying power, but there isn’t even the start of an idea of consensus yet. \n\nNotably absent from this discussion are any substantial announcements from the Prime Council. They continue to daily promise the announcement of a plan soon, but this plan has not materialized. In this silence, other factions from within the crew are gaining support.\n\nYou’ve spent the time lurking on a few different channels that more or less agree with your own opinions.\n\nToday, you check on the latest in your feed and find a Council message pinned to the top in bold. \"Announcement: Our Future\", it reads. You quickly open the message, curious and also nervous about what it might say.\n\nIt is a video file. The High Commander stands on the bridge at the forward tip of the Arvad, with the floor-to-ceiling bow windows looking out over what you instantly recognize as Bia. The planet is close and dominating the view, and you realize that this means that the Arvad is currently orbiting Bia, something the Council has neglected to formally mention to anyone outside of the bridge until now.\n\n\"Hello, this is the High Commander of the Arvad,\" she begins formally, as if anyone aboard still needs the introduction. \"There has been much discussion about which planet or moon to found our colony on recently, and that same debate has also been ongoing within Council Chambers. We have dismissed a number of our Subject Matter Experts with knowledge that is no longer relevant to the evolving situation and replaced them with new appointees possessing more applicable skills, but this has only decreased the amount of decorum and agreement within the Chambers.\n\nShe pauses and her stern look slips a little. \"Debate has, frankly, turned very ugly. Councillors and Subject Matter Experts are mostly pointing out flaws in any proposal put forward by anyone else, and very little constructive work is being done. And that’s not wrong. Every option really is a terrible option.\"\n\nShe takes a deep breath and draws herself up straight and tall. \"For two weeks now, I’ve tried to manage it and steer it and resolve it, but there is no consensus and we’ve waited too long already. In times of ship-wide emergency, the position of High Commander is granted sole executive power for the duration of that emergency.\"\n\nListening to this, you swear involuntarily.\n\n\"Effective immediately,\" the High Commander declares, \"the Arvad is in a state of ship-wide emergency. The survival of the crew demands immediate action to be undertaken. I am invoking emergency powers beginning now and continuing until such time that a functional colony has been established. I am fully aware of the seriousness of this action, but I believe that we are in more real danger than when my predecessor was faced with mutiny twelve years ago, and more immediate danger than the first time emergency powers were invoked back at the edge of the Solar System when the ship was knocked off course.\"\n\nYou swear again.\n\n\"As to the matter of the location of our colony, I have no doubt that if there was an acceptable answer, we would have found it during the last two weeks of intense debate. But we have not, because the simple answer is that every option of a planet or a moon is frankly worse than simply living in space.\"\n\n\"She’s a Stay-Aboard,\" you say out loud to no one.\n\n\"But the idea that we can simply stay on the Arvad is also unworkable. The ship is already a decade past her design life and cannot support the children already born, let alone any further people yet unborn. This is, you must remember, a transport ship. Not a space station. She was never intended to be used as anything more than a stellar power generation satellite after arrival at her destination.\"\n\n\"Well, what does that leave us!?\" you shout at the recording.\n\n\"So,\" the High Commander concludes, \"where does that leave us? My first order under emergency powers is to calculate a course to orbit the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt, which we have started calling ‘Adalia Prime’ within the Council. Upon arrival in orbit, we will simultaneously begin constructing a colony on the surface of said asteroid and deconstructing the Arvad in orbit above. Adalia Prime is only slightly smaller than Ceres back in the Solar System, so we will be using the colony that was built on Ceres as a template, using the last blueprints we have on file from before we lost contact with the Solar System sixty-four years ago.\"\n\n\"Yeah, ‘cause that worked out so well for them,\" you mutter to yourself. \n\n\"I know this is something of a risky proposal,\" the High Commander admits, \"but this is, I firmly believe, the least risky of many bad options. More announcements to follow promptly. Arvad Actual, over and out.\"\n\nYou sit in stunned silence for a moment.",

The breaking news is that the Security Department has arrested a member of the Prime Council for Insubordination. You follow the first link you find and get a video feed from the court martial.\n\nIt is a recording of the defense testimony, being delivered as a statement by the accused herself. You wonder briefly if this is by choice, and why she does not seem to have proper legal representation.\n\nThe caption on the screen identifies her as Morgan Murcheson, Head of External Maintenance. She looks shell shocked, and speaks in a flat monotone.\n\n\"I once again wish to state that I am not guilty of the charge of insubordination, Your Honor. I am aware that the evidence against me is quite strong, but it was not my intention for my actions to cross the line into an open challenge against the High Commander that could be considered an act of insubordination.\"\n\n\"Noted,\" the voice of the judge says. \"Do you have anything else to add?\"\n\n\"Uh, no,\" Murcheson says uncertainly. \"I don’t think so?\"\n\n\"Prosecution may begin cross examination now,\" says the judge.\n\n\"Thank you, Your Honor,\" the disembodied voice of the prosecutor offscreen begins. \"Do you deny any of the evidence?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Murcheson replies defensively. \"It happened exactly as it was recorded and entered into the minutes of the Council meeting. I’m just trying to show you that it wasn’t done with any malice.\"\n\n\"That is for this court to decide,\" the voice of the prosecutor says, still offscreen. \"Let’s go over it again, briefly, and we will determine if what you claim is the case. Okay, it says here in the minutes, and I quote, ‘6:16, High Commander appoints Councillor Murcheson to the new position of Head of Shipbreaking’, end quote. That was very nice of her, wasn’t it?\"\n\n\"It would have been quite an honor, if I had agreed with her that it was work worth doing.\"\n\n\"And how did you describe ‘the work’ to her less than a minute later, based on these minutes? It says here, quote, ‘6:16, Councillor Murcheson firmly declines the appointment’, end quote. What did you call this position?\"\n\nThe accused mumbles something difficult to make out.\n\n\"Speak up, please,\" the judge says firmly.\n\n\"I described the position as ‘Head of Butchery, Head of Desecration’,\" she says in a flat tone.\n\n\"And you are certain that those were your exact words?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she says, \"I’m reading from the transcript previously entered into evidence.\"\n\n\"It sounds like you were fairly negative about the High Commander’s plan.\"\n\n\"I was,\" she agrees.\n\n\"And you remain of the same opinion even now?\"\n\n\"I do,\" she confirms. \"I mean, I agree with the selection of Adalia Prime as the location of the colony. I only disagree about the need to dismantle the Arvad once we arrive there.\"\n\n\"But you disagreed quite strongly.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"During a time of a declared ship wide emergency, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are in that condition currently.\"\n\n\"You are aware of the legal authority of the High Commander during a declared emergency, correct?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And so, knowing that, you retracted your objections at once when the High Commander ordered you to take the position a minute later, at 6:17, correct?\"\n\n\"No, as you already know, I did not,\" she says. Gasps and murmurs from the court are picked up by her microphone. \"I said that she could not order me to destroy the ship I’d dedicated twenty-three years to preserving in my capacity as Head of External Maintenance for the Council.\"\n\n\"And was that an attempt to undermine the authority of the High Commander during a declared emergency by comparing your many years of service to the significantly shorter service of our High Commander, in spite of the fact that her authority is specifically not derived from length of service at all?\"\n\n\"That was not my intention,\"\n\nThere is a long silence before the prosecutor speaks again.\n\n\"Councillor Murcheson, would you please read your response to the High Commander’s order from the transcript in front of you? You will find that it has been highlighted for you.\"\n\nMurcheson looks slowly down at the page, and with a wavering voice, reads the line. \"‘I’ve spent the last twenty-three years of my life going over every square meter of the Arvad’s hull…’\" she trails off.\n\n\"Please continue,\" the prosecutor insists from off screen.\n\nMurcheson takes a deep, shaky breath and continues. \"‘…you’ve only been alive for twenty-three years total, so maybe…\" she trails off again, tears rolling down both cheeks.\n\n\"Just for the record,\" the prosecutor interrupts, \"the High Commander is in fact in her early thirties, but again I must stress how years of service are not a factor in her authority, at this time or at any time.\"\n\nThe camera has still not moved from the face of Councillor Murcheson during this aside, and she is silently sobbing.\n\n\"Murcheson, please finish the quote,\" the judge commands.\n\n\"‘…so maybe,’\" she gulps a breath of air and tries again \"‘So maybe you shouldn’t be the one to decide the fate of the Arvad.’\"\n\nThere is a lot more murmuring from the court after this, until the judge bangs his gavel for silence. Murcheson visibly recoils and shrinks down in her chair at the sound.\n\n\"The last three words, please,\" the prosecutor says.\n\nMurcheson looks petrified with fear, and says nothing.\n\n\"Councillor Murcheson,\" the judge says more forcefully, \"read the last three words of the quote.\"\n\nMurcheson’s finger reaches out to the tear-stained paper in front of her and points at the end of the highlighted passage. She opens her mouth and her lips move, but no words come out. She coughs violently, rubs her face with the sleeve of her jacket, and tries again.\n\n\"‘Maybe…I…should…’\" she reads slowly in a monotone.\n\n\"The prosecution rests, Your Honor.\" \n\n\"I see,\" says the judge. He slams his gavel. \"I have no choice but to find you guilty as charged, and sentence you to death by ejection from an airlock. Now is not the time to be pushing back against the High Commander’s leadership.\"\n\nThe clip ends abruptly, cutting the reaction of Murcheson to this sentence in mid-motion. Her red eyes are sweeping upwards to look at the judge as her jaw drops open in the opposite direction…and then her face is just gone. Video over. The end.",

The breaking news is that the Security Department has arrested a member of the Prime Council for Insubordination.

You wonder briefly if this is by choice, and why she does not seem to have proper legal representation.\n\nThe caption on the screen identifies her as Morgan Murcheson, Head of External Maintenance. She looks shell shocked, and speaks in a flat monotone.\n\n\"I once again wish to state that I am not guilty of the charge of insubordination, Your Honor. I am aware that the evidence against me is quite strong, but it was not my intention for my actions to cross the line into an open challenge against the High Commander that could be considered an act of insubordination.\"\n\n\"Noted,\" the voice of the judge says. \"Do you have anything else to add?\"\n\n\"Uh, no,\" Murcheson says uncertainly. \"I don’t think so?\"\n\n\"Prosecution may begin cross examination now,\" says the judge.\n\n\"Thank you, Your Honor,\" the disembodied voice of the prosecutor offscreen begins. \"Do you deny any of the evidence?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Murcheson replies defensively. \"It happened exactly as it was recorded and entered into the minutes of the Council meeting. I’m just trying to show you that it wasn’t done with any malice.\"\n\n\"That is for this court to decide,\" the voice of the prosecutor says, still offscreen. \"Let’s go over it again, briefly, and we will determine if what you claim is the case. Okay, it says here in the minutes, and I quote, ‘6:16, High Commander appoints Councillor Murcheson to the new position of Head of Shipbreaking’, end quote. That was very nice of her, wasn’t it?\"\n\n\"It would have been quite an honor, if I had agreed with her that it was work worth doing.\"\n\n\"And how did you describe ‘the work’ to her less than a minute later, based on these minutes? It says here, quote, ‘6:16, Councillor Murcheson firmly declines the appointment’, end quote. What did you call this position?\"\n\nThe accused mumbles something difficult to make out.\n\n\"Speak up, please,\" the judge says firmly.\n\n\"I described the position as ‘Head of Butchery, Head of Desecration’,\" she says in a flat tone.\n\n\"And you are certain that those were your exact words?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she says, \"I’m reading from the transcript previously entered into evidence.\"\n\n\"It sounds like you were fairly negative about the High Commander’s plan.\"\n\n\"I was,\" she agrees.\n\n\"And you remain of the same opinion even now?\"\n\n\"I do,\" she confirms. \"I mean, I agree with the selection of Adalia Prime as the location of the colony. I only disagree about the need to dismantle the Arvad once we arrive there.\"\n\n\"But you disagreed quite strongly.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"During a time of a declared ship wide emergency, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are in that condition currently.\"\n\n\"You are aware of the legal authority of the High Commander during a declared emergency, correct?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And so, knowing that, you retracted your objections at once when the High Commander ordered you to take the position a minute later, at 6:17, correct?\"\n\n\"No, as you already know, I did not,\" she says. Gasps and murmurs from the court are picked up by her microphone. \"I said that she could not order me to destroy the ship I’d dedicated twenty-three years to preserving in my capacity as Head of External Maintenance for the Council.\"\n\n\"And was that an attempt to undermine the authority of the High Commander during a declared emergency by comparing your many years of service to the significantly shorter service of our High Commander, in spite of the fact that her authority is specifically not derived from length of service at all?\"\n\n\"That was not my intention,\"\n\nThere is a long silence before the prosecutor speaks again.\n\n\"Councillor Murcheson, would you please read your response to the High Commander’s order from the transcript in front of you? You will find that it has been highlighted for you.\"\n\nMurcheson looks slowly down at the page, and with a wavering voice, reads the line. \"‘I’ve spent the last twenty-three years of my life going over every square meter of the Arvad’s hull…’\" she trails off.\n\n\"Please continue,\" the prosecutor insists from off screen.\n\nMurcheson takes a deep, shaky breath and continues. \"‘…you’ve only been alive for twenty-three years total, so maybe…\" she trails off again, tears rolling down both cheeks.\n\n\"Just for the record,\" the prosecutor interrupts, \"the High Commander is in fact in her early thirties, but again I must stress how years of service are not a factor in her authority, at this time or at any time.\"\n\nThe camera has still not moved from the face of Councillor Murcheson during this aside, and she is silently sobbing.\n\n\"Murcheson, please finish the quote,\" the judge commands.\n\n\"‘…so maybe,’\" she gulps a breath of air and tries again \"‘So maybe you shouldn’t be the one to decide the fate of the Arvad.’\"\n\nThere is a lot more murmuring from the court after this, until the judge bangs his gavel for silence. Murcheson visibly recoils and shrinks down in her chair at the sound.\n\n\"The last three words, please,\" the prosecutor says.\n\nMurcheson looks petrified with fear, and says nothing.\n\n\"Councillor Murcheson,\" the judge says more forcefully, \"read the last three words of the quote.\"\n\nMurcheson’s finger reaches out to the tear-stained paper in front of her and points at the end of the highlighted passage. She opens her mouth and her lips move, but no words come out. She coughs violently, rubs her face with the sleeve of her jacket, and tries again.\n\n\"‘Maybe…I…should…’\" she reads slowly in a monotone.\n\n\"The prosecution rests, Your Honor.\" \n\n\"I see,\" says the judge. He slams his gavel. \"I have no choice but to find you guilty as charged, and sentence you to death by ejection from an airlock. Now is not the time to be pushing back against the High Commander’s leadership.\"\n\nThe clip ends abruptly, cutting the reaction of Murcheson to this sentence in mid-motion. Her red eyes are sweeping upwards to look at the judge as her jaw drops open in the opposite direction…and then her face is just gone. Video over. The end.",

Behind him is the High Commander herself, in full dress uniform. She walks up to the stand, trailing two armored Security Officers behind her. The Head of Security stays by the door, still scanning the room.\n\n\"Just for the record,\" the prosecutor begins, \"you are the current High Commander of the ship, correct?\"\n\n\"That is correct, yes.\" The High Commander says.\n\n\"Please remind the court of the duties of High Commander.\"\n\n\"Normally, it is a largely administrative role, responsible for heading the meetings of the Prime Council and ensuring that everything is performed in the proper fashion,\" she says. \"It’s a little like the job of a judge, in a way.\"\n\nThe judge frowns slightly at this, cocks his head to the side slightly, then nods in agreement.\n\n\"And when you say ‘normally’, what do you mean by that?\" continues the prosecutor.\n\n\"Well, any time that there is not a ship-wide emergency being declared.\"\n\n\"Which there currently is, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are in a state of emergency from now until we have established a colony on the surface of Adalia Prime.\"\n\n\"And what level of power does the office of High Commander have during a state of emergency?\"\n\n\"Absolute power,\" the High Commander confirms. \"When the survival of the ship is at stake, all decision-making power is granted to the High Commander for the duration.\"\n\n\"Can the Council continue to advise the High Commander during such times?\"\n\n\"They can,\" agrees the High Commander.\n\n\"During such times, can Council members refuse direct orders from the High Commander?\"\n\n\"They cannot.\"\n\n\"Last night, did you offer a new position to the accused, Councillor Morgan Murcheson, the current Head of External Maintenance?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"What position?\"\n\n\"Head of Shipbreaking,\" the High Commander says. \"I felt it would be a good fit, considering her previous excellence in her role in External Maintenance.\"\n\n\"Are Councillors allowed to turn down offers of new positions from the High Commander during a state of emergency?\"\n\n\"As long as they do it respectfully, yes.\"\n\n\"And, in your opinion, was Councillor Murcheson respectful?\"\n\n\"She was not.\"\n\n\"We have the minutes and the transcript, but, in your own words, what happened next?\"\n\n\"I ordered her to take the position.\"\n\n\"In spite of her lack of respect?\"\n\n\"My order was motivated by her extensive knowledge and experience in her role. She was simply the best option, and I needed her for this critical part of my plan to resolve the emergency.\"\n\n\"So this is not a case of you reacting emotionally to her outburst, correct? You were calm and rational as you attempted to convince her that her skills were essential in an effort to keep everyone alive?\"\n\n\"Well, it’s a little debatable as to how much of my reasoning was expressed verbally at this moment – the transcript records my exact words – but it’s moot. I had already previously established how vital the task of shipbreaking was to my plan, and also how indispensable the External Maintenance department in general and Councillor Murcheson in specific were to it. Anyway, I had by this point ordered it, so it was no longer optional.\"\n\n\"And are Councillors allowed to refuse direct orders from the High Commander during a declared emergency?\"\n\n\"They are not,\" said the High Commander flatly.\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n\"Well, the transcript records exactly what happened next, and I’m sure you will cover that in more detail later on, but in the interest of brevity, she made an attempt on my job.\"\n\n\"She made a power grab for the title of High Commander during a Council meeting?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How would you describe the state of the ship at this moment, Commander?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\n\"The ship is in a state of extreme danger.\"\n\n\"Would you elaborate?\"\n\n\"We need to get off of this ship and onto a colony immediately. The original plan was for this to have already happened ten years ago, but the Adalia System is one light year farther from the Solar System than our original target. The extra decade of unplanned travel time is a direct result of that.\"\n\n\"You have selected a colony site as part of your emergency plan.\"\n\n\"Yes, the asteroid Adalia Prime.\"\n\n\"Accepting briefly that public sentiment is irrelevant during a state of emergency, how has the level of public support for your plan been?\"\n\n\"Quite poor. Far too much time was wasted while both the public and the Council debated options that all ultimately proved completely unsuitable for a colony.\"\n\n\"And how has support been after the declaration of emergency?\"\n\n\"Radicalism and resistance have risen sharply. Minor acts of sabotage are happening throughout the ship. Inventory shrink has shot up more than six hundred percent as people pilfer and horde the vital supplies that we all need for survival. Multiple people persist in the arguments for colony locations and political systems that are not Adalia Prime and Prime Council leadership. Resistance to the emergency plan has shaved six percent off our chances of survival, based on the best models we have built. There have been three confirmed attempts on my life.\"\n\nThe courtroom is completely silent.\n\n\"What…what…\" the prosecutor is stunned and pale, shaken from his practiced presentation. He swallows and tries again. \"What is our chance of survival, based on your models?\"\n\nThe High Commander looks embarrassed. \"I didn’t actually intend to include that one in my summary. I’m sorry, but that is a closely held secret. Please forget I said anything about the models.\"\n\n\"Yes, but,\" interrupts the judge, \"what are our chances?\"\n\n\"Well, they are six percent lower than they were this time last week,\" says the High Commander.\n\nSilence descends on the courtroom again.\n\nThe prosecutor is the first one to recover. \"So, this is the environment in which Councillor Murcheson’s insubordination and refusal of a direct order during a state of emergency occurred?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" says the High Commander. \"A dire situation and a lack of leadership lead to a breakdown in consensus and Council support, which has lead to a state of emergency, which has lead to the need for immediate decisive leadership in accordance with the existence of the office of High Commander, which has lead to a further increase in shortsighted resistance to the Council and me. Newton’s Second Law, in action. And if left to run unopposed, it will lead to our deaths. That’s why Councillor Murcheson’s mutinous statements-\"\n\nThe judge hits his gavel once, sharply. \"The accused is on trial for insubordination, not mutiny,\" he says.\n\n\"Sorry,\" the High Commander corrects, \"her insubordinate statements are a deadly serious matter. Her refusal to do her duty hurts all of our chances at survival.\"\n\n\"Thank you, High Commander,\" the prosecutor says, \"no further questions.\"\n\nThe High Commander stands to leave, and as she makes for the exit the two Security Officers that have been standing on the wall behind her this whole time suddenly fall in behind her and follow her out. You had forgotten they were even there, you had been watching her testimony so closely.",

The Head of Security stays by the door, still scanning the room.\n\n\"Just for the record,\" the prosecutor begins, \"you are the current High Commander of the ship, correct?\"\n\n\"That is correct, yes.\" The High Commander says.\n\n\"Please remind the court of the duties of High Commander.\"\n\n\"Normally, it is a largely administrative role, responsible for heading the meetings of the Prime Council and ensuring that everything is performed in the proper fashion,\" she says. \"It’s a little like the job of a judge, in a way.\"\n\nThe judge frowns slightly at this, cocks his head to the side slightly, then nods in agreement.\n\n\"And when you say ‘normally’, what do you mean by that?\" continues the prosecutor.\n\n\"Well, any time that there is not a ship-wide emergency being declared.\"\n\n\"Which there currently is, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are in a state of emergency from now until we have established a colony on the surface of Adalia Prime.\"\n\n\"And what level of power does the office of High Commander have during a state of emergency?\"\n\n\"Absolute power,\" the High Commander confirms. \"When the survival of the ship is at stake, all decision-making power is granted to the High Commander for the duration.\"\n\n\"Can the Council continue to advise the High Commander during such times?\"\n\n\"They can,\" agrees the High Commander.\n\n\"During such times, can Council members refuse direct orders from the High Commander?\"\n\n\"They cannot.\"\n\n\"Last night, did you offer a new position to the accused, Councillor Morgan Murcheson, the current Head of External Maintenance?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"What position?\"\n\n\"Head of Shipbreaking,\" the High Commander says. \"I felt it would be a good fit, considering her previous excellence in her role in External Maintenance.\"\n\n\"Are Councillors allowed to turn down offers of new positions from the High Commander during a state of emergency?\"\n\n\"As long as they do it respectfully, yes.\"\n\n\"And, in your opinion, was Councillor Murcheson respectful?\"\n\n\"She was not.\"\n\n\"We have the minutes and the transcript, but, in your own words, what happened next?\"\n\n\"I ordered her to take the position.\"\n\n\"In spite of her lack of respect?\"\n\n\"My order was motivated by her extensive knowledge and experience in her role. She was simply the best option, and I needed her for this critical part of my plan to resolve the emergency.\"\n\n\"So this is not a case of you reacting emotionally to her outburst, correct? You were calm and rational as you attempted to convince her that her skills were essential in an effort to keep everyone alive?\"\n\n\"Well, it’s a little debatable as to how much of my reasoning was expressed verbally at this moment – the transcript records my exact words – but it’s moot. I had already previously established how vital the task of shipbreaking was to my plan, and also how indispensable the External Maintenance department in general and Councillor Murcheson in specific were to it. Anyway, I had by this point ordered it, so it was no longer optional.\"\n\n\"And are Councillors allowed to refuse direct orders from the High Commander during a declared emergency?\"\n\n\"They are not,\" said the High Commander flatly.\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n\"Well, the transcript records exactly what happened next, and I’m sure you will cover that in more detail later on, but in the interest of brevity, she made an attempt on my job.\"\n\n\"She made a power grab for the title of High Commander during a Council meeting?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How would you describe the state of the ship at this moment, Commander?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\n\"The ship is in a state of extreme danger.\"\n\n\"Would you elaborate?\"\n\n\"We need to get off of this ship and onto a colony immediately. The original plan was for this to have already happened ten years ago, but the Adalia System is one light year farther from the Solar System than our original target. The extra decade of unplanned travel time is a direct result of that.\"\n\n\"You have selected a colony site as part of your emergency plan.\"\n\n\"Yes, the asteroid Adalia Prime.\"\n\n\"Accepting briefly that public sentiment is irrelevant during a state of emergency, how has the level of public support for your plan been?\"\n\n\"Quite poor. Far too much time was wasted while both the public and the Council debated options that all ultimately proved completely unsuitable for a colony.\"\n\n\"And how has support been after the declaration of emergency?\"\n\n\"Radicalism and resistance have risen sharply. Minor acts of sabotage are happening throughout the ship. Inventory shrink has shot up more than six hundred percent as people pilfer and horde the vital supplies that we all need for survival. Multiple people persist in the arguments for colony locations and political systems that are not Adalia Prime and Prime Council leadership. Resistance to the emergency plan has shaved six percent off our chances of survival, based on the best models we have built. There have been three confirmed attempts on my life.\"\n\nThe courtroom is completely silent.\n\n\"What…what…\" the prosecutor is stunned and pale, shaken from his practiced presentation. He swallows and tries again. \"What is our chance of survival, based on your models?\"\n\nThe High Commander looks embarrassed. \"I didn’t actually intend to include that one in my summary. I’m sorry, but that is a closely held secret. Please forget I said anything about the models.\"\n\n\"Yes, but,\" interrupts the judge, \"what are our chances?\"\n\n\"Well, they are six percent lower than they were this time last week,\" says the High Commander.\n\nSilence descends on the courtroom again.\n\nThe prosecutor is the first one to recover. \"So, this is the environment in which Councillor Murcheson’s insubordination and refusal of a direct order during a state of emergency occurred?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" says the High Commander. \"A dire situation and a lack of leadership lead to a breakdown in consensus and Council support, which has lead to a state of emergency, which has lead to the need for immediate decisive leadership in accordance with the existence of the office of High Commander, which has lead to a further increase in shortsighted resistance to the Council and me. Newton’s Second Law, in action. And if left to run unopposed, it will lead to our deaths. That’s why Councillor Murcheson’s mutinous statements-\"\n\nThe judge hits his gavel once, sharply. \"The accused is on trial for insubordination, not mutiny,\" he says.\n\n\"Sorry,\" the High Commander corrects, \"her insubordinate statements are a deadly serious matter. Her refusal to do her duty hurts all of our chances at survival.\"\n\n\"Thank you, High Commander,\" the prosecutor says, \"no further questions.\"\n\nThe High Commander stands to leave, and as she makes for the exit the two Security Officers that have been standing on the wall behind her this whole time suddenly fall in behind her and follow her out. You had forgotten they were even there, you had been watching her testimony so closely.",

The Head of Security stays by the door, still scanning the room.\n\n\"Just for the record,\" the prosecutor begins, \"you are the current High Commander of the ship, correct?\"\n\n\"That is correct, yes.\" The High Commander says.\n\n\"Please remind the court of the duties of High Commander.\"\n\n\"Normally, it is a largely administrative role, responsible for heading the meetings of the Prime Council and ensuring that everything is performed in the proper fashion,\" she says. \"It’s a little like the job of a judge, in a way.\"\n\nThe judge frowns slightly at this, cocks his head to the side slightly, then nods in agreement.\n\n\"And when you say ‘normally’, what do you mean by that?\" continues the prosecutor.\n\n\"Well, any time that there is not a ship-wide emergency being declared.\"\n\n\"Which there currently is, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are in a state of emergency from now until we have established a colony on the surface of Adalia Prime.\"\n\n\"And what level of power does the office of High Commander have during a state of emergency?\"\n\n\"Absolute power,\" the High Commander confirms. \"When the survival of the ship is at stake, all decision-making power is granted to the High Commander for the duration.\"\n\n\"Can the Council continue to advise the High Commander during such times?\"\n\n\"They can,\" agrees the High Commander.\n\n\"During such times, can Council members refuse direct orders from the High Commander?\"\n\n\"They cannot.\"\n\n\"Last night, did you offer a new position to the accused, Councillor Morgan Murcheson, the current Head of External Maintenance?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"What position?\"\n\n\"Head of Shipbreaking,\" the High Commander says. \"I felt it would be a good fit, considering her previous excellence in her role in External Maintenance.\"\n\n\"Are Councillors allowed to turn down offers of new positions from the High Commander during a state of emergency?\"\n\n\"As long as they do it respectfully, yes.\"\n\n\"And, in your opinion, was Councillor Murcheson respectful?\"\n\n\"She was not.\"\n\n\"We have the minutes and the transcript, but, in your own words, what happened next?\"\n\n\"I ordered her to take the position.\"\n\n\"In spite of her lack of respect?\"\n\n\"My order was motivated by her extensive knowledge and experience in her role. She was simply the best option, and I needed her for this critical part of my plan to resolve the emergency.\"\n\n\"So this is not a case of you reacting emotionally to her outburst, correct? You were calm and rational as you attempted to convince her that her skills were essential in an effort to keep everyone alive?\"\n\n\"Well, it’s a little debatable as to how much of my reasoning was expressed verbally at this moment – the transcript records my exact words – but it’s moot. I had already previously established how vital the task of shipbreaking was to my plan, and also how indispensable the External Maintenance department in general and Councillor Murcheson in specific were to it. Anyway, I had by this point ordered it, so it was no longer optional.\"\n\n\"And are Councillors allowed to refuse direct orders from the High Commander during a declared emergency?\"\n\n\"They are not,\" said the High Commander flatly.\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\n\"Well, the transcript records exactly what happened next, and I’m sure you will cover that in more detail later on, but in the interest of brevity, she made an attempt on my job.\"\n\n\"She made a power grab for the title of High Commander during a Council meeting?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How would you describe the state of the ship at this moment, Commander?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\n\"The ship is in a state of extreme danger.\"\n\n\"Would you elaborate?\"\n\n\"We need to get off of this ship and onto a colony immediately. The original plan was for this to have already happened ten years ago, but the Adalia System is one light year farther from the Solar System than our original target. The extra decade of unplanned travel time is a direct result of that.\"\n\n\"You have selected a colony site as part of your emergency plan.\"\n\n\"Yes, the asteroid Adalia Prime.\"\n\n\"Accepting briefly that public sentiment is irrelevant during a state of emergency, how has the level of public support for your plan been?\"\n\n\"Quite poor. Far too much time was wasted while both the public and the Council debated options that all ultimately proved completely unsuitable for a colony.\"\n\n\"And how has support been after the declaration of emergency?\"\n\n\"Radicalism and resistance have risen sharply. Minor acts of sabotage are happening throughout the ship. Inventory shrink has shot up more than six hundred percent as people pilfer and horde the vital supplies that we all need for survival. Multiple people persist in the arguments for colony locations and political systems that are not Adalia Prime and Prime Council leadership. Resistance to the emergency plan has shaved six percent off our chances of survival, based on the best models we have built. There have been three confirmed attempts on my life.\"\n\nThe courtroom is completely silent.\n\n\"What…what…\" the prosecutor is stunned and pale, shaken from his practiced presentation. He swallows and tries again. \"What is our chance of survival, based on your models?\"\n\nThe High Commander looks embarrassed. \"I didn’t actually intend to include that one in my summary. I’m sorry, but that is a closely held secret. Please forget I said anything about the models.\"\n\n\"Yes, but,\" interrupts the judge, \"what are our chances?\"\n\n\"Well, they are six percent lower than they were this time last week,\" says the High Commander.\n\nSilence descends on the courtroom again.\n\nThe prosecutor is the first one to recover. \"So, this is the environment in which Councillor Murcheson’s insubordination and refusal of a direct order during a state of emergency occurred?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" says the High Commander. \"A dire situation and a lack of leadership lead to a breakdown in consensus and Council support, which has lead to a state of emergency, which has lead to the need for immediate decisive leadership in accordance with the existence of the office of High Commander, which has lead to a further increase in shortsighted resistance to the Council and me. Newton’s Second Law, in action. And if left to run unopposed, it will lead to our deaths. That’s why Councillor Murcheson’s mutinous statements-\"\n\nThe judge hits his gavel once, sharply. \"The accused is on trial for insubordination, not mutiny,\" he says.\n\n\"Sorry,\" the High Commander corrects, \"her insubordinate statements are a deadly serious matter. Her refusal to do her duty hurts all of our chances at survival.\"\n\n\"Thank you, High Commander,\" the prosecutor says, \"no further questions.\"\n\nThe High Commander stands to leave, and as she makes for the exit the two Security Officers that have been standing on the wall behind her this whole time suddenly fall in behind her and follow her out. You had forgotten they were even there, you had been watching her testimony so closely.",

On your first day you forgot to add your weighted outer-boots and an enthusiastic jump from the surface resulted in a 90 second journey up, and then back down. The low gravity of Adalia Prime makes it perfect for the new surface transport vehicles that have been developed and assigned to your crew for maintenance and use in delivering materials from transports from the Arvad to the various stations in the new colony. There is only a small amount of force needed to have the vehicles hover above the asteroid’s surface and then they fly across the landscape with a speed that would make your hair blow-back… if there were an atmosphere… and you somehow forgot your helmet.",

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou are not surprised that these thieves have been caught and are satisfied that they will face swift justice. Maybe once the colony is built, people like this can slink away and live alone on far-off asteroids, but for now they need to keep their hands off things that don’t belong to them.\n\nHopefully, any other thieves out there will learn to stop pilfering, or, at the very least, more of these thieves can be found and brought to justice. \n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to.

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou go a little pale. You know that what you’ve already done could get you in a lot of trouble. Maybe even as much trouble as these prisoners. You need to stop; to get out now. No more \"supply drops\" to your contacts, that’s for sure.\n\nOr maybe…just maybe. What if you made a deal with the Security Division, and turned in your contacts with the Radicals? That should square up your own part in the conspiracy, right? The Public Safety Officers don’t really want you as much as the ringleaders, surely.\n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to. You can stick with me and keep doing what you’ve been doing, or you can transfer to a different work party for the next week.

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nWhile you feel that severe punishment isn’t necessary, you are glad to hear that at least these defendants won’t be taking communal supplies for their own benefit.\n\nBut regardless of how selfishly they have been acting, they are still members of the community, and punishing them severely will only hurt the colony in the long run. You hope that those in charge focus more on rehabilitation than retribution. \n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to. You can stick with me and keep doing what you’ve been doing, or you can transfer to a different work party for the next week. We’re ahead of schedule here, but there’s a couple of teams that aren’t rockstars like us. I need a couple of volunteers to go help them out.\"",

The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou swear under your breath. Maybe you have been a little fast and loose with some of the supplies near your work area, but you haven’t done anything that would justify a court martial…right?\n\nYou really need to swing by your locker when no one is watching, and take some things out of it.

The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury.

They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou are not surprised that these thieves have been caught and are satisfied that they will face swift justice. Maybe once the colony is built, people like this can slink away and live alone on far-off asteroids, but for now they need to keep their hands off things that don’t belong to them.\n\nHopefully, any other thieves out there will learn to stop pilfering, or, at the very least, more of these thieves can be found and brought to justice. \n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to.

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou are not surprised that these thieves have been caught and are satisfied that they will face swift justice. Maybe once the colony is built, people like this can slink away and live alone on far-off asteroids, but for now they need to keep their hands off things that don’t belong to them.\n\nHopefully, any other thieves out there will learn to stop pilfering, or, at the very least, more of these thieves can be found and brought to justice. \n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to. You can stick with me and keep doing what you’ve been doing, or you can transfer to a different work party for the next week. We’re ahead of schedule here, but there’s a couple of teams that aren’t rockstars like us. I need a couple of volunteers to go help them out.\"",

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou are not surprised that these thieves have been caught and are satisfied that they will face swift justice. Maybe once the colony is built, people like this can slink away and live alone on far-off asteroids, but for now they need to keep their hands off things that don’t belong to them.\n\nHopefully, any other thieves out there will learn to stop pilfering, or, at the very least, more of these thieves can be found and brought to justice. \n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to.

They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nSince this happened in a completely different work area, far from you, you don’t see that this really affects you.

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou go a little pale. You know that what you’ve already done could get you in a lot of trouble. Maybe even as much trouble as these prisoners. You need to stop; to get out now. No more \"supply drops\" to your contacts, that’s for sure.\n\nOr maybe…just maybe. What if you made a deal with the Security Division, and turned in your contacts with the Radicals? That should square up your own part in the conspiracy, right? The Public Safety Officers don’t really want you as much as the ringleaders, surely.\n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to.

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular.

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou are not surprised that these thieves have been caught and are satisfied that they will face swift justice. Maybe once the colony is built, people like this can slink away and live alone on far-off asteroids, but for now they need to keep their hands off things that don’t belong to them.\n\nHopefully, any other thieves out there will learn to stop pilfering, or, at the very least, more of these thieves can be found and brought to justice. \n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to.

The big news is that a group of people have been arrested for stealing supplies - nowhere near where you have been working - and are awaiting a court martial at the court, which is still part of the Arvad this week.\n\nThere have already been preliminary arguments made by both sides. The accused have rejected the authority of the Prime Council, and demand to be tried by a jury of their peers, which they argue must be comprised of no fewer than six Independents.\n\nIn response, the High Commander has ordered that the trial will be conducted pursuant to Emergency Powers rules and procedures, and will only have a judge; no jury. She has appointed the same judge that previously ordered the execution of Morgan Murcheson - a clear sign of her intentions - and rejects out-of-hand even the existence of an Independent power bloc as a valid political entity.\n\nThe defense opposes a bench trial in general, and the High Commander’s choice of judge in particular. They have made a motion to recuse the judge, but since the judge for the case and the High Commander are the only ones that could grant this, they aren’t very hopeful.\n\nYou are not surprised that these thieves have been caught and are satisfied that they will face swift justice. Maybe once the colony is built, people like this can slink away and live alone on far-off asteroids, but for now they need to keep their hands off things that don’t belong to them.\n\nHopefully, any other thieves out there will learn to stop pilfering, or, at the very least, more of these thieves can be found and brought to justice. \n\nBut there isn’t time for anything more than your initial gut reaction to the news, because the supervisor of your work party barks out a sharp \"hey, you!\", and it’s time to get back to work.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says, \"here’s the deal.\"\n\nShe points the index finger of her right hand at the open palm of her outstretched left hand, as if ‘the deal’ was a small trinket sitting there.\n\n\"There’s an opportunity to change it up a bit,\" she continues, \"if you want to. You can stick with me and keep doing what you’ve been doing, or you can transfer to a different work party for the next week.

It has become increasingly clear as the Arvad has been dismantled that the High Commander was right, and that the ship was never intended to be a long-term space station.\n\nOnly a miniscule crew remains in orbit with the Arvad, and they often ride down to the surface after long shifts to spend some off-duty time at the colony, rather than stay up on the increasingly silent and empty hulk. \n\nAdalian life is colony life now.

There’s a tiny hint of predictability, a feeling that’s been in short supply for a long time.\n\nBig news events punctuate the rhythm at a steady pace.

But the tone of justice has mellowed since Councillor Murcheson was briefly sentenced to death via airlock, and the Judge sentences each pilfering defendant to a year in the colony’s newly constructed brig, along with re-education. \n\nNot long after the sentencing comes an interesting announcement: the Arvad has now been completely dismantled. As you walk through a hallway to your quarters in your new home you take a moment to look around you, appreciating how the ship has not been destroyed, but instead repurposed into the smoothly curved walls around you. She is still protecting you from the cold vacuum of endless space, but her form and function have changed, while her materials remain the same. She is almost like the inverse of Theseus’ ship, she is no longer a ship but the metal that made up her hull is still your home. \n\nThe sleeping quarters are mostly communal for now, and are rarely silent. But an unexpected hush falls over the crowded space, punctuated by a few raised voices and a few more calling for quiet. The High Commander’s face appears on your Muse, and someone quickly projects the message onto the open space of a nearby wall. \n\n\"Hello, this is the High Commander of the Arvad…\" she pauses, \"...sort of.\"\n\nA tiny hint of what looks like a smirk or a smile tugs at the left corner of her lips.\n\n\"Until quite recently, I was the High Commander of our beloved Arvad.

She was made up of her crew. We didn’t just send a ship to the stars, we sent life. We sent ourselves. And here we all are, in Adalia. And the Arvad is still here too. Just look around yourself, wherever you are right now. That’s the Arvad you see. That’s us.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and you see just a little more of that smile on her face.\n\n\"The colony is complete. The colonists are safe.\" She takes a deep breath. \"The emergency is over.\"\n\nShe breathes out slowly, settling her shoulders and relaxing her forehead.\n\n\"Effective immediately, the State of Emergency is resolved. Emergency Powers are suspended indefinitely, and executive power is returned to the Prime Council. The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden. I am glad to have done it, and I would not have done any of it differently if I had the chance.\n\n\"But, at this time, I feel that I have fulfilled my duty and responsibilities. There will always be more challenges to face, but others are ready to face them.

An unmistakable, full face smile. You try to remember the last time you’ve seen her like this. Before the colony, before the Emergency Powers, before the brief-but-intense age of Adalian politics. Not since that first deceleration burn into the Adalian system, probably.\n\n\"I want to thank all of you for all of your hard work during these hard times. Thank you to those that supported me through all of it, but also to all those that didn’t support me. No one should ever enjoy complete support, especially if they already possess absolute power.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and it looks like she might even be tearing up a bit.\n\n\"Personally,\" she continues, \"I’ve had enough of power and politics for one lifetime. While there are a quarter-million asteroids out there in this belt waiting for you all to explore them, I’m going to get a mining drill, a little smelter, and a few plots on the surface of this asteroid, just out past the limits of this colony.

You realize that this might be her last speech ever.\n\nShe finally smiles another little smile, looking happy, emotional, proud, and exhausted all at once.\n\n\"Welcome to Adalia, everyone. Citizen Natus, over and out.\"\n\nAnd she’s gone. The broadcast ends.\n\n\"Uh, what do we do now?\" someone asks out loud. \"What next?\"\n\n\"A drill, a little smelter, and a few plots of surface, out past the colony,\" you find yourself answering, almost automatically. \"Just like she said.\""

While never entirely care-free, your life seemed much lighter back then, free from the mounting problems that you have all faced during the past few months.\n\nBut then the trial goes into a long recess, because the courthouse itself is part of the next section to be cut away and brought down to the surface.\n\nThings settle down on the net again, until orders come down from the Prime Council concerning work duties.\n\nA video announcement from the Chief Logistics Officer and the Chief Steward plays on your Muse, where they briefly explain that the Prime Council has determined that to increase the overall chance of survival for the colony, everyone needs to develop more than one skill.

Just look around yourself, wherever you are right now. That’s the Arvad you see. That’s us.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and you see just a little more of that smile on her face.\n\n\"The colony is complete. The colonists are safe.\" She takes a deep breath. \"The emergency is over.\"\n\nShe breathes out slowly, settling her shoulders and relaxing her forehead.\n\n\"Effective immediately, the State of Emergency is resolved. Emergency Powers are suspended indefinitely, and executive power is returned to the Prime Council. The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden. I am glad to have done it, and I would not have done any of it differently if I had the chance.\n\n\"But, at this time, I feel that I have fulfilled my duty and responsibilities. There will always be more challenges to face, but others are ready to face them. I have accomplished what I swore I would, and having completed this work, I am now standing down.\n\n\"I resign as High Commander of the Arvad, effective immediately.\"\n\nThere are a few gasps and murmurs from the audience watching with you.\n\n\"I resign my position on the Prime Council as well, effective immediately.\"\n\nA few more gasps and hushed comments.\n\n\"The remaining members of the Prime Council may select a new High Commander at their discretion, although I humbly put forward that the powers and responsibilities of the office may need some adjustment now that the Arvad is no longer a ship, in the traditional sense.\"\n\nAt this, the (former) High Commander actually smiles. An unmistakable, full face smile. You try to remember the last time you’ve seen her like this. Before the colony, before the Emergency Powers, before the brief-but-intense age of Adalian politics. Not since that first deceleration burn into the Adalian system, probably.\n\n\"I want to thank all of you for all of your hard work during these hard times. Thank you to those that supported me through all of it, but also to all those that didn’t support me. No one should ever enjoy complete support, especially if they already possess absolute power.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and it looks like she might even be tearing up a bit.\n\n\"Personally,\" she continues, \"I’ve had enough of power and politics for one lifetime. While there are a quarter-million asteroids out there in this belt waiting for you all to explore them, I’m going to get a mining drill, a little smelter, and a few plots on the surface of this asteroid, just out past the limits of this colony.

That’s us.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and you see just a little more of that smile on her face.\n\n\"The colony is complete.

Emergency Powers are suspended indefinitely, and executive power is returned to the Prime Council. The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden.

But an unexpected hush falls over the crowded space, punctuated by a few raised voices and a few more calling for quiet.

She was made up of her crew. We didn’t just send a ship to the stars, we sent life. We sent ourselves. And here we all are, in Adalia. And the Arvad is still here too. Just look around yourself, wherever you are right now. That’s the Arvad you see. That’s us.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and you see just a little more of that smile on her face.\n\n\"The colony is complete. The colonists are safe.\" She takes a deep breath. \"The emergency is over.\"\n\nShe breathes out slowly, settling her shoulders and relaxing her forehead.\n\n\"Effective immediately, the State of Emergency is resolved. Emergency Powers are suspended indefinitely, and executive power is returned to the Prime Council. The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden. I am glad to have done it, and I would not have done any of it differently if I had the chance.\n\n\"But, at this time, I feel that I have fulfilled my duty and responsibilities. There will always be more challenges to face, but others are ready to face them. I have accomplished what I swore I would, and having completed this work, I am now standing down.\n\n\"I resign as High Commander of the Arvad, effective immediately.\"\n\nThere are a few gasps and murmurs from the audience watching with you.\n\n\"I resign my position on the Prime Council as well, effective immediately.\"\n\nA few more gasps and hushed comments.\n\n\"The remaining members of the Prime Council may select a new High Commander at their discretion, although I humbly put forward that the powers and responsibilities of the office may need some adjustment now that the Arvad is no longer a ship, in the traditional sense.\"\n\nAt this, the (former) High Commander actually smiles. An unmistakable, full face smile. You try to remember the last time you’ve seen her like this. Before the colony, before the Emergency Powers, before the brief-but-intense age of Adalian politics. Not since that first deceleration burn into the Adalian system, probably.\n\n\"I want to thank all of you for all of your hard work during these hard times. Thank you to those that supported me through all of it, but also to all those that didn’t support me. No one should ever enjoy complete support, especially if they already possess absolute power.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and it looks like she might even be tearing up a bit.\n\n\"Personally,\" she continues, \"I’ve had enough of power and politics for one lifetime. While there are a quarter-million asteroids out there in this belt waiting for you all to explore them, I’m going to get a mining drill, a little smelter, and a few plots on the surface of this asteroid, just out past the limits of this colony. That will be enough for me for now. \"  \n\nShe falls silent again, and looks as if she’s trying to find anything else that needs to be said for a moment. You realize that this might be her last speech ever.\n\nShe finally smiles another little smile, looking happy, emotional, proud, and exhausted all at once.\n\n\"Welcome to Adalia, everyone. Citizen Natus, over and out.\"\n\nAnd she’s gone. The broadcast ends.\n\n\"Uh, what do we do now?\" someone asks out loud. \"What next?\"\n\n\"A drill, a little smelter, and a few plots of surface, out past the colony,\" you find yourself answering, almost automatically. \"Just like she said.\""

But the tone of justice has mellowed since Councillor Murcheson was briefly sentenced to death via airlock, and the Judge sentences each pilfering defendant to a year in the colony’s newly constructed brig, along with re-education. \n\nNot long after the sentencing comes an interesting announcement: the Arvad has now been completely dismantled. As you walk through a hallway to your quarters in your new home you take a moment to look around you, appreciating how the ship has not been destroyed, but instead repurposed into the smoothly curved walls around you. She is still protecting you from the cold vacuum of endless space, but her form and function have changed, while her materials remain the same. She is almost like the inverse of Theseus’ ship, she is no longer a ship but the metal that made up her hull is still your home. \n\nThe sleeping quarters are mostly communal for now, and are rarely silent.

Emergency Powers are suspended indefinitely, and executive power is returned to the Prime Council. The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden.

An unmistakable, full face smile. You try to remember the last time you’ve seen her like this. Before the colony, before the Emergency Powers, before the brief-but-intense age of Adalian politics. Not since that first deceleration burn into the Adalian system, probably.\n\n\"I want to thank all of you for all of your hard work during these hard times. Thank you to those that supported me through all of it, but also to all those that didn’t support me. No one should ever enjoy complete support, especially if they already possess absolute power.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and it looks like she might even be tearing up a bit.\n\n\"Personally,\" she continues, \"I’ve had enough of power and politics for one lifetime.

She was made up of her crew. We didn’t just send a ship to the stars, we sent life. We sent ourselves. And here we all are, in Adalia. And the Arvad is still here too. Just look around yourself, wherever you are right now. That’s the Arvad you see. That’s us.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and you see just a little more of that smile on her face.\n\n\"The colony is complete. The colonists are safe.\" She takes a deep breath. \"The emergency is over.\"\n\nShe breathes out slowly, settling her shoulders and relaxing her forehead.\n\n\"Effective immediately, the State of Emergency is resolved. Emergency Powers are suspended indefinitely, and executive power is returned to the Prime Council. The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden. I am glad to have done it, and I would not have done any of it differently if I had the chance.\n\n\"But, at this time, I feel that I have fulfilled my duty and responsibilities. There will always be more challenges to face, but others are ready to face them. I have accomplished what I swore I would, and having completed this work, I am now standing down.\n\n\"I resign as High Commander of the Arvad, effective immediately.\"\n\nThere are a few gasps and murmurs from the audience watching with you.\n\n\"I resign my position on the Prime Council as well, effective immediately.\"\n\nA few more gasps and hushed comments.\n\n\"The remaining members of the Prime Council may select a new High Commander at their discretion, although I humbly put forward that the powers and responsibilities of the office may need some adjustment now that the Arvad is no longer a ship, in the traditional sense.\"\n\nAt this, the (former) High Commander actually smiles. An unmistakable, full face smile. You try to remember the last time you’ve seen her like this. Before the colony, before the Emergency Powers, before the brief-but-intense age of Adalian politics. Not since that first deceleration burn into the Adalian system, probably.\n\n\"I want to thank all of you for all of your hard work during these hard times.

No one should ever enjoy complete support, especially if they already possess absolute power.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and it looks like she might even be tearing up a bit.\n\n\"Personally,\" she continues, \"I’ve had enough of power and politics for one lifetime. While there are a quarter-million asteroids out there in this belt waiting for you all to explore them, I’m going to get a mining drill, a little smelter, and a few plots on the surface of this asteroid, just out past the limits of this colony. That will be enough for me for now. \"  \n\nShe falls silent again, and looks as if she’s trying to find anything else that needs to be said for a moment. You realize that this might be her last speech ever.\n\nShe finally smiles another little smile, looking happy, emotional, proud, and exhausted all at once.\n\n\"Welcome to Adalia, everyone. Citizen Natus, over and out.\"\n\nAnd she’s gone. The broadcast ends.\n\n\"Uh, what do we do now?\" someone asks out loud. \"What next?\"\n\n\"A drill, a little smelter, and a few plots of surface, out past the colony,\" you find yourself answering, almost automatically. \"Just like she said.\""

She is still protecting you from the cold vacuum of endless space, but her form and function have changed, while her materials remain the same. She is almost like the inverse of Theseus’ ship, she is no longer a ship but the metal that made up her hull is still your home. \n\nThe sleeping quarters are mostly communal for now, and are rarely silent. But an unexpected hush falls over the crowded space, punctuated by a few raised voices and a few more calling for quiet. The High Commander’s face appears on your Muse, and someone quickly projects the message onto the open space of a nearby wall. \n\n\"Hello, this is the High Commander of the Arvad…\" she pauses, \"...sort of.\"\n\nA tiny hint of what looks like a smirk or a smile tugs at the left corner of her lips.\n\n\"Until quite recently, I was the High Commander of our beloved Arvad. I know that there have been those that have doubted my commitment to the ship - one quite publicly described me as her ‘butcher’ recently - but know that my respect for and love of our fine ship is genuine.\n\n\"But the Arvad was made of more than metal and glass. She was made up of her crew. We didn’t just send a ship to the stars, we sent life. We sent ourselves. And here we all are, in Adalia. And the Arvad is still here too. Just look around yourself, wherever you are right now. That’s the Arvad you see. That’s us.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and you see just a little more of that smile on her face.\n\n\"The colony is complete. The colonists are safe.\" She takes a deep breath. \"The emergency is over.\"\n\nShe breathes out slowly, settling her shoulders and relaxing her forehead.\n\n\"Effective immediately, the State of Emergency is resolved. Emergency Powers are suspended indefinitely, and executive power is returned to the Prime Council. The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden. I am glad to have done it, and I would not have done any of it differently if I had the chance.\n\n\"But, at this time, I feel that I have fulfilled my duty and responsibilities. There will always be more challenges to face, but others are ready to face them. I have accomplished what I swore I would, and having completed this work, I am now standing down.\n\n\"I resign as High Commander of the Arvad, effective immediately.\"\n\nThere are a few gasps and murmurs from the audience watching with you.\n\n\"I resign my position on the Prime Council as well, effective immediately.\"\n\nA few more gasps and hushed comments.\n\n\"The remaining members of the Prime Council may select a new High Commander at their discretion, although I humbly put forward that the powers and responsibilities of the office may need some adjustment now that the Arvad is no longer a ship, in the traditional sense.\"\n\nAt this, the (former) High Commander actually smiles. An unmistakable, full face smile. You try to remember the last time you’ve seen her like this. Before the colony, before the Emergency Powers, before the brief-but-intense age of Adalian politics. Not since that first deceleration burn into the Adalian system, probably.\n\n\"I want to thank all of you for all of your hard work during these hard times. Thank you to those that supported me through all of it, but also to all those that didn’t support me. No one should ever enjoy complete support, especially if they already possess absolute power.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and it looks like she might even be tearing up a bit.\n\n\"Personally,\" she continues, \"I’ve had enough of power and politics for one lifetime. While there are a quarter-million asteroids out there in this belt waiting for you all to explore them, I’m going to get a mining drill, a little smelter, and a few plots on the surface of this asteroid, just out past the limits of this colony. That will be enough for me for now. \"  \n\nShe falls silent again, and looks as if she’s trying to find anything else that needs to be said for a moment. You realize that this might be her last speech ever.\n\nShe finally smiles another little smile, looking happy, emotional, proud, and exhausted all at once.\n\n\"Welcome to Adalia, everyone. Citizen Natus, over and out.\"\n\nAnd she’s gone. The broadcast ends.\n\n\"Uh, what do we do now?\" someone asks out loud. \"What next?\"\n\n\"A drill, a little smelter, and a few plots of surface, out past the colony,\" you find yourself answering, almost automatically. \"Just like she said.\""

It is possible that she was only a year behind you when you were both young students. While never entirely care-free, your life seemed much lighter back then, free from the mounting problems that you have all faced during the past few months.\n\nBut then the trial goes into a long recess, because the courthouse itself is part of the next section to be cut away and brought down to the surface.\n\nThings settle down on the net again, until orders come down from the Prime Council concerning work duties.\n\nA video announcement from the Chief Logistics Officer and the Chief Steward plays on your Muse, where they briefly explain that the Prime Council has determined that to increase the overall chance of survival for the colony, everyone needs to develop more than one skill.

It is possible that she was only a year behind you when you were both young students. While never entirely care-free, your life seemed much lighter back then, free from the mounting problems that you have all faced during the past few months.\n\nBut then the trial goes into a long recess, because the courthouse itself is part of the next section to be cut away and brought down to the surface.\n\nThings settle down on the net again, until orders come down from the Prime Council concerning work duties.\n\nA video announcement from the Chief Logistics Officer and the Chief Steward plays on your Muse, where they briefly explain that the Prime Council has determined that to increase the overall chance of survival for the colony, everyone needs to develop more than one skill.

The Security Division will stand down from direct enforcement of my orders and resume their normal duties under their usual powers.\"\n\nThe others in your quarters cheer, and you hear more distant cheers echoing through the curve of the main hallway from farther away.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" the High Commander continues, \"During my brief mandate, I have had more of an impact on more lives than I could have ever imagined when I first accepted the nomination of the rest of the Council to this position.\" She sighs. \"It has been my honor to serve as your High Commander, but it has also been a very heavy burden. I am glad to have done it, and I would not have done any of it differently if I had the chance.\n\n\"But, at this time, I feel that I have fulfilled my duty and responsibilities. There will always be more challenges to face, but others are ready to face them. I have accomplished what I swore I would, and having completed this work, I am now standing down.\n\n\"I resign as High Commander of the Arvad, effective immediately.\"\n\nThere are a few gasps and murmurs from the audience watching with you.\n\n\"I resign my position on the Prime Council as well, effective immediately.\"\n\nA few more gasps and hushed comments.\n\n\"The remaining members of the Prime Council may select a new High Commander at their discretion, although I humbly put forward that the powers and responsibilities of the office may need some adjustment now that the Arvad is no longer a ship, in the traditional sense.\"\n\nAt this, the (former) High Commander actually smiles. An unmistakable, full face smile. You try to remember the last time you’ve seen her like this. Before the colony, before the Emergency Powers, before the brief-but-intense age of Adalian politics. Not since that first deceleration burn into the Adalian system, probably.\n\n\"I want to thank all of you for all of your hard work during these hard times. Thank you to those that supported me through all of it, but also to all those that didn’t support me. No one should ever enjoy complete support, especially if they already possess absolute power.\"\n\nShe pauses for a moment, and it looks like she might even be tearing up a bit.\n\n\"Personally,\" she continues, \"I’ve had enough of power and politics for one lifetime. While there are a quarter-million asteroids out there in this belt waiting for you all to explore them, I’m going to get a mining drill, a little smelter, and a few plots on the surface of this asteroid, just out past the limits of this colony. That will be enough for me for now. \"  \n\nShe falls silent again, and looks as if she’s trying to find anything else that needs to be said for a moment. You realize that this might be her last speech ever.\n\nShe finally smiles another little smile, looking happy, emotional, proud, and exhausted all at once.\n\n\"Welcome to Adalia, everyone. Citizen Natus, over and out.\"\n\nAnd she’s gone. The broadcast ends.\n\n\"Uh, what do we do now?\" someone asks out loud. \"What next?\"\n\n\"A drill, a little smelter, and a few plots of surface, out past the colony,\" you find yourself answering, almost automatically. \"Just like she said.\""

It is possible that she was only a year behind you when you were both young students. While never entirely care-free, your life seemed much lighter back then, free from the mounting problems that you have all faced during the past few months.\n\nBut then the trial goes into a long recess, because the courthouse itself is part of the next section to be cut away and brought down to the surface.\n\nThings settle down on the net again, until orders come down from the Prime Council concerning work duties.\n\nA video announcement from the Chief Logistics Officer and the Chief Steward plays on your Muse, where they briefly explain that the Prime Council has determined that to increase the overall chance of survival for the colony, everyone needs to develop more than one skill. The candid nature with which they talk about survival is surprising, but also refreshing.\n\nIt appears that the Council has had enough of secrecy and is finally ready to trust the people to have some hand in determining their own fates again.",
