It is the absolute foundation of the Adalian economy and helping break rock will never go out of style.\n\nPlus, it’s the type of life that just appeals to you. Boots on the surface of an asteroid, finding out what lies beneath, exploring somewhere no human has ever been before - and the added bonus of getting paid well, if what you find is in high demand. What’s not to love?\n\nYou enroll in the remote learning sessions run by the Allen Mining Company. The introductory session is hosted by Harriet Auburn, former Chief Steward of the Arvad, and Scott Allen, descendant of the Allen mining oligarchs that sourced the raw materials that the great generational ships were built from, including the Arvad herself. \n\n\"Future miners of Adalia, I’m glad to see so many of you here today,\" Auburn begins. \"Deep space asteroid mining was an extremely niche field of study up until very recently, and no one knows it better than Scott, here.\" Auburn gestures to Scott Allen, his eyes sparkling under his bushy gray eyebrows as he continues with the introduction, \"It is immensely gratifying to see it become so central to our growing civilization now, during what I foolishly thought would be my years of peaceful retirement. But these days, no miner is ever really done with their work, I suppose.\"\n\nHe pauses for a second, studying the video feeds on his screen.\n\n\"Oh, it’s not that bad!\" he reassures the audience. \"Once it is all set up properly, most of the mining process is fairly automated, honestly. It’s hard work for a little while, sure, but there’s also plenty of time to reflect on the great mysteries of life and the universe until the storage fills up or the trouble light comes on. You’ll all be part-time philosophers by the time you’re my age.\"\n\n\"Mmmhmm, part-time philosophers, for sure,\" Auburn agrees, with a small smile. \"But first,\" she continues, coming back on topic, \"there’s some more immediate and practical book learning to do. Setting up an excavator and turning it on may look easy at first glance, but knowing exactly where to set it up in the first place is an art and a science. By the time you graduate, you will know so much about reading the surface of an asteroid and working out what is going on below the outer layer that you will always be sought out for your skill.\"",

It is the absolute foundation of the Adalian economy and helping break rock will never go out of style.\n\nPlus, it’s the type of life that just appeals to you. Boots on the surface of an asteroid, finding out what lies beneath, exploring somewhere no human has ever been before - and the added bonus of getting paid well, if what you find is in high demand. What’s not to love?\n\nYou enroll in the remote learning sessions run by the Allen Mining Company. The introductory session is hosted by Harriet Auburn, former Chief Steward of the Arvad, and Scott Allen, descendant of the Allen mining oligarchs that sourced the raw materials that the great generational ships were built from, including the Arvad herself. \n\n\"Future miners of Adalia, I’m glad to see so many of you here today,\" Auburn begins. \"Deep space asteroid mining was an extremely niche field of study up until very recently, and no one knows it better than Scott, here.\" Auburn gestures to Scott Allen, his eyes sparkling under his bushy gray eyebrows as he continues with the introduction, \"It is immensely gratifying to see it become so central to our growing civilization now, during what I foolishly thought would be my years of peaceful retirement. But these days, no miner is ever really done with their work, I suppose.\"\n\nHe pauses for a second, studying the video feeds on his screen.\n\n\"Oh, it’s not that bad!\" he reassures the audience. \"Once it is all set up properly, most of the mining process is fairly automated, honestly. It’s hard work for a little while, sure, but there’s also plenty of time to reflect on the great mysteries of life and the universe until the storage fills up or the trouble light comes on. You’ll all be part-time philosophers by the time you’re my age.\"\n\n\"Mmmhmm, part-time philosophers, for sure,\" Auburn agrees, with a small smile. \"But first,\" she continues, coming back on topic, \"there’s some more immediate and practical book learning to do. Setting up an excavator and turning it on may look easy at first glance, but knowing exactly where to set it up in the first place is an art and a science. By the time you graduate, you will know so much about reading the surface of an asteroid and working out what is going on below the outer layer that you will always be sought out for your skill.\"",

It is the absolute foundation of the Adalian economy and helping break rock will never go out of style.\n\nPlus, it’s the type of life that just appeals to you. Boots on the surface of an asteroid, finding out what lies beneath, exploring somewhere no human has ever been before - and the added bonus of getting paid well, if what you find is in high demand. What’s not to love?\n\nYou enroll in the remote learning sessions run by the Allen Mining Company. The introductory session is hosted by Harriet Auburn, former Chief Steward of the Arvad, and Scott Allen, descendant of the Allen mining oligarchs that sourced the raw materials that the great generational ships were built from, including the Arvad herself. \n\n\"Future miners of Adalia, I’m glad to see so many of you here today,\" Auburn begins. \"Deep space asteroid mining was an extremely niche field of study up until very recently, and no one knows it better than Scott, here.\" Auburn gestures to Scott Allen, his eyes sparkling under his bushy gray eyebrows as he continues with the introduction, \"It is immensely gratifying to see it become so central to our growing civilization now, during what I foolishly thought would be my years of peaceful retirement. But these days, no miner is ever really done with their work, I suppose.\"\n\nHe pauses for a second, studying the video feeds on his screen.\n\n\"Oh, it’s not that bad!\" he reassures the audience. \"Once it is all set up properly, most of the mining process is fairly automated, honestly. It’s hard work for a little while, sure, but there’s also plenty of time to reflect on the great mysteries of life and the universe until the storage fills up or the trouble light comes on. You’ll all be part-time philosophers by the time you’re my age.\"\n\n\"Mmmhmm, part-time philosophers, for sure,\" Auburn agrees, with a small smile. \"But first,\" she continues, coming back on topic, \"there’s some more immediate and practical book learning to do. Setting up an excavator and turning it on may look easy at first glance, but knowing exactly where to set it up in the first place is an art and a science. By the time you graduate, you will know so much about reading the surface of an asteroid and working out what is going on below the outer layer that you will always be sought out for your skill.\"",

It is the absolute foundation of the Adalian economy and helping break rock will never go out of style.\n\nPlus, it’s the type of life that just appeals to you. Boots on the surface of an asteroid, finding out what lies beneath, exploring somewhere no human has ever been before - and the added bonus of getting paid well, if what you find is in high demand. What’s not to love?\n\nYou enroll in the remote learning sessions run by the Allen Mining Company. The introductory session is hosted by Harriet Auburn, former Chief Steward of the Arvad, and Scott Allen, descendant of the Allen mining oligarchs that sourced the raw materials that the great generational ships were built from, including the Arvad herself. \n\n\"Future miners of Adalia, I’m glad to see so many of you here today,\" Auburn begins. \"Deep space asteroid mining was an extremely niche field of study up until very recently, and no one knows it better than Scott, here.\" Auburn gestures to Scott Allen, his eyes sparkling under his bushy gray eyebrows as he continues with the introduction, \"It is immensely gratifying to see it become so central to our growing civilization now, during what I foolishly thought would be my years of peaceful retirement. But these days, no miner is ever really done with their work, I suppose.\"\n\nHe pauses for a second, studying the video feeds on his screen.\n\n\"Oh, it’s not that bad!\" he reassures the audience. \"Once it is all set up properly, most of the mining process is fairly automated, honestly. It’s hard work for a little while, sure, but there’s also plenty of time to reflect on the great mysteries of life and the universe until the storage fills up or the trouble light comes on. You’ll all be part-time philosophers by the time you’re my age.\"\n\n\"Mmmhmm, part-time philosophers, for sure,\" Auburn agrees, with a small smile. \"But first,\" she continues, coming back on topic, \"there’s some more immediate and practical book learning to do. Setting up an excavator and turning it on may look easy at first glance, but knowing exactly where to set it up in the first place is an art and a science.

You are confident in your choice to become an engineer, and while this career might not garner as much prestige as scientists, or as much money as merchants, everyone knows how indispensable an engineer is when something goes wrong. \n\nYou enroll in the North Adalian Trade School, one of the engineering certification courses that have sprung up around the belt since the engineers of the Arvad made it possible to dismantle the great ship and create the first settlement on Adalia Prime. \n\nEager to begin learning more about how everything around you works, and breaks, and can be repaired to work again, you signed up for the earliest orientation session available. The video begins abruptly and, without any introduction, the name of the last Head of Engineering of the Arvad appears at the bottom of the screen, with the man himself sitting front and center. Vikram Jay Stephenson has the look of a man who is perpetually busy, either in his work or in his mind. Even as he begins speaking, you can’t help notice that his attention seems divided between the encouraging talk meant for you, and the clutter of what appears to be a disassembled engine scattered around his workspace.\n\n\"You will be taught not just the basics of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and such, but how to harness that knowledge to build, fix, improve everything that the average person uses everyday! Whether you choose to specialize in ships or building or refining or any one of the dozens of other possibilities, you will learn not just the what but the how. Being an engineer is about more than just testing hypotheses, it is about learning how to think so that you can solve any problem that comes your way.\" The subtle jab at the scientists’ academy does not go unnoticed by your new classmates and elicits a few quiet smirks around you.\n\nStephenson goes on, \"Remember, there is a beauty in precision, in efficiency, in not only making a cold, hard chunk of metal come to life and do what you want it to, but to do it well.\" He makes a vague gesture toward the plant sitting behind him. The four broad leaves, two stick-like stems, and ghostly pale aerial roots give it an alien appearance, although, you suppose, all plants are technically alien to Adalia. You can see that while the orchid only has one open bloom at the moment, many more will soon follow.  \"Strive for excellence, don’t compromise on quality, and your reputation as a great engineer, and a vital part of any crew, will grow.\"",

You are confident in your choice to become an engineer, and while this career might not garner as much prestige as scientists, or as much money as merchants, everyone knows how indispensable an engineer is when something goes wrong. \n\nYou enroll in the North Adalian Trade School, one of the engineering certification courses that have sprung up around the belt since the engineers of the Arvad made it possible to dismantle the great ship and create the first settlement on Adalia Prime. \n\nEager to begin learning more about how everything around you works, and breaks, and can be repaired to work again, you signed up for the earliest orientation session available. The video begins abruptly and, without any introduction, the name of the last Head of Engineering of the Arvad appears at the bottom of the screen, with the man himself sitting front and center. Vikram Jay Stephenson has the look of a man who is perpetually busy, either in his work or in his mind. Even as he begins speaking, you can’t help notice that his attention seems divided between the encouraging talk meant for you, and the clutter of what appears to be a disassembled engine scattered around his workspace.\n\n\"You will be taught not just the basics of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and such, but how to harness that knowledge to build, fix, improve everything that the average person uses everyday! Whether you choose to specialize in ships or building or refining or any one of the dozens of other possibilities, you will learn not just the what but the how. Being an engineer is about more than just testing hypotheses, it is about learning how to think so that you can solve any problem that comes your way.\" The subtle jab at the scientists’ academy does not go unnoticed by your new classmates and elicits a few quiet smirks around you.\n\nStephenson goes on, \"Remember, there is a beauty in precision, in efficiency, in not only making a cold, hard chunk of metal come to life and do what you want it to, but to do it well.\" He makes a vague gesture toward the plant sitting behind him. The four broad leaves, two stick-like stems, and ghostly pale aerial roots give it an alien appearance, although, you suppose, all plants are technically alien to Adalia. You can see that while the orchid only has one open bloom at the moment, many more will soon follow.  \"Strive for excellence, don’t compromise on quality, and your reputation as a great engineer, and a vital part of any crew, will grow.\"",

You are confident in your choice to become an engineer, and while this career might not garner as much prestige as scientists, or as much money as merchants, everyone knows how indispensable an engineer is when something goes wrong. \n\nYou enroll in the North Adalian Trade School, one of the engineering certification courses that have sprung up around the belt since the engineers of the Arvad made it possible to dismantle the great ship and create the first settlement on Adalia Prime. \n\nEager to begin learning more about how everything around you works, and breaks, and can be repaired to work again, you signed up for the earliest orientation session available. The video begins abruptly and, without any introduction, the name of the last Head of Engineering of the Arvad appears at the bottom of the screen, with the man himself sitting front and center. Vikram Jay Stephenson has the look of a man who is perpetually busy, either in his work or in his mind. Even as he begins speaking, you can’t help notice that his attention seems divided between the encouraging talk meant for you, and the clutter of what appears to be a disassembled engine scattered around his workspace.\n\n\"You will be taught not just the basics of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and such, but how to harness that knowledge to build, fix, improve everything that the average person uses everyday! Whether you choose to specialize in ships or building or refining or any one of the dozens of other possibilities, you will learn not just the what but the how. Being an engineer is about more than just testing hypotheses, it is about learning how to think so that you can solve any problem that comes your way.\" The subtle jab at the scientists’ academy does not go unnoticed by your new classmates and elicits a few quiet smirks around you.\n\nStephenson goes on, \"Remember, there is a beauty in precision, in efficiency, in not only making a cold, hard chunk of metal come to life and do what you want it to, but to do it well.\" He makes a vague gesture toward the plant sitting behind him. The four broad leaves, two stick-like stems, and ghostly pale aerial roots give it an alien appearance, although, you suppose, all plants are technically alien to Adalia. You can see that while the orchid only has one open bloom at the moment, many more will soon follow.  \"Strive for excellence, don’t compromise on quality, and your reputation as a great engineer, and a vital part of any crew, will grow.\"",

You are confident in your choice to become an engineer, and while this career might not garner as much prestige as scientists, or as much money as merchants, everyone knows how indispensable an engineer is when something goes wrong. \n\nYou enroll in the North Adalian Trade School, one of the engineering certification courses that have sprung up around the belt since the engineers of the Arvad made it possible to dismantle the great ship and create the first settlement on Adalia Prime. \n\nEager to begin learning more about how everything around you works, and breaks, and can be repaired to work again, you signed up for the earliest orientation session available. The video begins abruptly and, without any introduction, the name of the last Head of Engineering of the Arvad appears at the bottom of the screen, with the man himself sitting front and center. Vikram Jay Stephenson has the look of a man who is perpetually busy, either in his work or in his mind. Even as he begins speaking, you can’t help notice that his attention seems divided between the encouraging talk meant for you, and the clutter of what appears to be a disassembled engine scattered around his workspace.\n\n\"You will be taught not just the basics of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and such, but how to harness that knowledge to build, fix, improve everything that the average person uses everyday! Whether you choose to specialize in ships or building or refining or any one of the dozens of other possibilities, you will learn not just the what but the how. Being an engineer is about more than just testing hypotheses, it is about learning how to think so that you can solve any problem that comes your way.\" The subtle jab at the scientists’ academy does not go unnoticed by your new classmates and elicits a few quiet smirks around you.\n\nStephenson goes on, \"Remember, there is a beauty in precision, in efficiency, in not only making a cold, hard chunk of metal come to life and do what you want it to, but to do it well.\" He makes a vague gesture toward the plant sitting behind him. The four broad leaves, two stick-like stems, and ghostly pale aerial roots give it an alien appearance, although, you suppose, all plants are technically alien to Adalia. You can see that while the orchid only has one open bloom at the moment, many more will soon follow.  \"Strive for excellence, don’t compromise on quality, and your reputation as a great engineer, and a vital part of any crew, will grow.\"",

Buying low, selling high, and putting the difference in your pocket sounds like a great way to make a living in the belt.\n\nAlthough anyone can call themselves a merchant, you decide to receive academic training in the fundamentals from an accredited school, the Merchants of Venus, who advertise their training with the tongue-in-cheek tagline: \"Let us be your morning star, your evening star, your guiding light in the darkest corners of the Adalian marketplace.\"\n\nThe first day of your course starts with a remote lecture hosted by Mason Quince, who is not an academic but a real working merchant operating in the Outer Rim, and former Entertainment Director of the Arvad. He introduces himself briefly before starting on the main topic of his lecture.\n\n\"I do these guest lectures for two key reasons,\" he begins, \"because I want to illustrate why knowing the fundamentals is key to being an effective merchant, and because the school pays me handsomely for my time.\" He smiles slyly at this, then continues.\n\n\"Everyone knows the old ‘buy low, sell high’ truism, and too many aspiring merchants think that’s all there is to it. And, sure, that’s part of it. You see that widgets are 10 SWAY here and 11 SWAY over there, and you think to yourself, ‘cool, that’s 1 SWAY profit per widget!’\" But you forgot the fees to buy the widgets here, the propellant and fuel to get them there, the docking fees, and the market fees at your destination. Suddenly, it’s not worth moving those widgets, is it? In the real world there’s even more to it.\"\n\n\"You learn the fundamentals so that you can glean insights and make plans. Shipping widgets around chasing small price gradients is work for bulk cargo haulers with algorithms picking their manifests. Small independents like yourselves will get ground to dust going up against big operations like that. That’s a race-to-the-bottom game that you want to stay well away from.\n\n\"You want to be looking for what bulk hauler algorithms can’t see, and make moves that put you in good positions for the next trade and the trade after that. You need to know not just the numbers, but the humanity hiding behind those numbers. Understanding economics is impossible without first understanding people. That’s what you will learn here, and that’s what’s going to put you in a position to make the whole belt work better and more efficiently. And earn yourself some SWAY doing it, of course.\"",

Buying low, selling high, and putting the difference in your pocket sounds like a great way to make a living in the belt.\n\nAlthough anyone can call themselves a merchant, you decide to receive academic training in the fundamentals from an accredited school, the Merchants of Venus, who advertise their training with the tongue-in-cheek tagline: \"Let us be your morning star, your evening star, your guiding light in the darkest corners of the Adalian marketplace.\"\n\nThe first day of your course starts with a remote lecture hosted by Mason Quince, who is not an academic but a real working merchant operating in the Outer Rim, and former Entertainment Director of the Arvad. He introduces himself briefly before starting on the main topic of his lecture.\n\n\"I do these guest lectures for two key reasons,\" he begins, \"because I want to illustrate why knowing the fundamentals is key to being an effective merchant, and because the school pays me handsomely for my time.\" He smiles slyly at this, then continues.\n\n\"Everyone knows the old ‘buy low, sell high’ truism, and too many aspiring merchants think that’s all there is to it. And, sure, that’s part of it. You see that widgets are 10 SWAY here and 11 SWAY over there, and you think to yourself, ‘cool, that’s 1 SWAY profit per widget!’\" But you forgot the fees to buy the widgets here, the propellant and fuel to get them there, the docking fees, and the market fees at your destination. Suddenly, it’s not worth moving those widgets, is it? In the real world there’s even more to it.\"\n\n\"You learn the fundamentals so that you can glean insights and make plans. Shipping widgets around chasing small price gradients is work for bulk cargo haulers with algorithms picking their manifests. Small independents like yourselves will get ground to dust going up against big operations like that. That’s a race-to-the-bottom game that you want to stay well away from.\n\n\"You want to be looking for what bulk hauler algorithms can’t see, and make moves that put you in good positions for the next trade and the trade after that. You need to know not just the numbers, but the humanity hiding behind those numbers. Understanding economics is impossible without first understanding people. That’s what you will learn here, and that’s what’s going to put you in a position to make the whole belt work better and more efficiently. And earn yourself some SWAY doing it, of course.\"",

Buying low, selling high, and putting the difference in your pocket sounds like a great way to make a living in the belt.\n\nAlthough anyone can call themselves a merchant, you decide to receive academic training in the fundamentals from an accredited school, the Merchants of Venus, who advertise their training with the tongue-in-cheek tagline: \"Let us be your morning star, your evening star, your guiding light in the darkest corners of the Adalian marketplace.\"\n\nThe first day of your course starts with a remote lecture hosted by Mason Quince, who is not an academic but a real working merchant operating in the Outer Rim, and former Entertainment Director of the Arvad. He introduces himself briefly before starting on the main topic of his lecture.\n\n\"I do these guest lectures for two key reasons,\" he begins, \"because I want to illustrate why knowing the fundamentals is key to being an effective merchant, and because the school pays me handsomely for my time.\" He smiles slyly at this, then continues.\n\n\"Everyone knows the old ‘buy low, sell high’ truism, and too many aspiring merchants think that’s all there is to it. And, sure, that’s part of it. You see that widgets are 10 SWAY here and 11 SWAY over there, and you think to yourself, ‘cool, that’s 1 SWAY profit per widget!’\" But you forgot the fees to buy the widgets here, the propellant and fuel to get them there, the docking fees, and the market fees at your destination. Suddenly, it’s not worth moving those widgets, is it? In the real world there’s even more to it.\"\n\n\"You learn the fundamentals so that you can glean insights and make plans. Shipping widgets around chasing small price gradients is work for bulk cargo haulers with algorithms picking their manifests. Small independents like yourselves will get ground to dust going up against big operations like that. That’s a race-to-the-bottom game that you want to stay well away from.\n\n\"You want to be looking for what bulk hauler algorithms can’t see, and make moves that put you in good positions for the next trade and the trade after that. You need to know not just the numbers, but the humanity hiding behind those numbers. Understanding economics is impossible without first understanding people. That’s what you will learn here, and that’s what’s going to put you in a position to make the whole belt work better and more efficiently. And earn yourself some SWAY doing it, of course.\"",

Buying low, selling high, and putting the difference in your pocket sounds like a great way to make a living in the belt.\n\nAlthough anyone can call themselves a merchant, you decide to receive academic training in the fundamentals from an accredited school, the Merchants of Venus, who advertise their training with the tongue-in-cheek tagline: \"Let us be your morning star, your evening star, your guiding light in the darkest corners of the Adalian marketplace.\"\n\nThe first day of your course starts with a remote lecture hosted by Mason Quince, who is not an academic but a real working merchant operating in the Outer Rim, and former Entertainment Director of the Arvad. He introduces himself briefly before starting on the main topic of his lecture.\n\n\"I do these guest lectures for two key reasons,\" he begins, \"because I want to illustrate why knowing the fundamentals is key to being an effective merchant, and because the school pays me handsomely for my time.\" He smiles slyly at this, then continues.\n\n\"Everyone knows the old ‘buy low, sell high’ truism, and too many aspiring merchants think that’s all there is to it. And, sure, that’s part of it. You see that widgets are 10 SWAY here and 11 SWAY over there, and you think to yourself, ‘cool, that’s 1 SWAY profit per widget!’\" But you forgot the fees to buy the widgets here, the propellant and fuel to get them there, the docking fees, and the market fees at your destination. Suddenly, it’s not worth moving those widgets, is it? In the real world there’s even more to it.\"\n\n\"You learn the fundamentals so that you can glean insights and make plans. Shipping widgets around chasing small price gradients is work for bulk cargo haulers with algorithms picking their manifests. Small independents like yourselves will get ground to dust going up against big operations like that. That’s a race-to-the-bottom game that you want to stay well away from.\n\n\"You want to be looking for what bulk hauler algorithms can’t see, and make moves that put you in good positions for the next trade and the trade after that. You need to know not just the numbers, but the humanity hiding behind those numbers. Understanding economics is impossible without first understanding people. That’s what you will learn here, and that’s what’s going to put you in a position to make the whole belt work better and more efficiently. And earn yourself some SWAY doing it, of course.\"",

While you know that some Adalians don’t understand the appeal of being a scientist, as it is seldom considered to be one of the most lucrative fields, you just can’t imagine a life where you don’t get the opportunity to investigate, invent, learn, and move humanity forward.\n\nAfter passing the tricky entrance examination, you enroll in The Academy for the Study and Promotion of Sciences for Humanity (or The Academy, as it is affectionately referred to by its attendees). The Academy not only certifies scientists, but also offers further advanced certifications which would enable you to one day become a medical doctor or doctor of philosophy. It is known for its exacting standards and, consequently, its high drop-out rate.\n\nWith a bit of trepidation you meet the few other prospective scientists at one of the student labs in your habitat to view the orientation video. Dr. Susan Blackwell, the last Chief Medical Officer of the Arvad, appears on the screen. She emanates the kind of calm confidence that comes from years of careful study of one’s chosen field, and her friendly smile immediately puts you at ease, reminding you of your first pediatrician, the one who alway had a silly joke to share at every appointment.\n\n\"Hello future scientists! I’m so excited to welcome you to The Academy! Not only will you receive an excellent education in the experimental sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics, but here you will supplement your education with courses in the social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Because each of you must remember our goal here, we want to further our understanding of the universe, yes, but most of all we want to help each other survive. We want humanity to continue to thrive in our little pocket of the universe!\"\n\nWhatever anxiety you were feeling about beginning this course of study is pushed to the side by the excitement you feel at the prospect of learning something new. You are looking forward to using the knowledge that you gain to one day invent something that no one in Adalia has ever seen before.",

While you know that some Adalians don’t understand the appeal of being a scientist, as it is seldom considered to be one of the most lucrative fields, you just can’t imagine a life where you don’t get the opportunity to investigate, invent, learn, and move humanity forward.\n\nAfter passing the tricky entrance examination, you enroll in The Academy for the Study and Promotion of Sciences for Humanity (or The Academy, as it is affectionately referred to by its attendees). The Academy not only certifies scientists, but also offers further advanced certifications which would enable you to one day become a medical doctor or doctor of philosophy. It is known for its exacting standards and, consequently, its high drop-out rate.\n\nWith a bit of trepidation you meet the few other prospective scientists at one of the student labs in your habitat to view the orientation video. Dr. Susan Blackwell, the last Chief Medical Officer of the Arvad, appears on the screen. She emanates the kind of calm confidence that comes from years of careful study of one’s chosen field, and her friendly smile immediately puts you at ease, reminding you of your first pediatrician, the one who alway had a silly joke to share at every appointment.\n\n\"Hello future scientists! I’m so excited to welcome you to The Academy! Not only will you receive an excellent education in the experimental sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics, but here you will supplement your education with courses in the social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Because each of you must remember our goal here, we want to further our understanding of the universe, yes, but most of all we want to help each other survive. We want humanity to continue to thrive in our little pocket of the universe!\"\n\nWhatever anxiety you were feeling about beginning this course of study is pushed to the side by the excitement you feel at the prospect of learning something new. You are looking forward to using the knowledge that you gain to one day invent something that no one in Adalia has ever seen before.",

While you know that some Adalians don’t understand the appeal of being a scientist, as it is seldom considered to be one of the most lucrative fields, you just can’t imagine a life where you don’t get the opportunity to investigate, invent, learn, and move humanity forward.\n\nAfter passing the tricky entrance examination, you enroll in The Academy for the Study and Promotion of Sciences for Humanity (or The Academy, as it is affectionately referred to by its attendees). The Academy not only certifies scientists, but also offers further advanced certifications which would enable you to one day become a medical doctor or doctor of philosophy. It is known for its exacting standards and, consequently, its high drop-out rate.\n\nWith a bit of trepidation you meet the few other prospective scientists at one of the student labs in your habitat to view the orientation video. Dr. Susan Blackwell, the last Chief Medical Officer of the Arvad, appears on the screen. She emanates the kind of calm confidence that comes from years of careful study of one’s chosen field, and her friendly smile immediately puts you at ease, reminding you of your first pediatrician, the one who alway had a silly joke to share at every appointment.\n\n\"Hello future scientists! I’m so excited to welcome you to The Academy! Not only will you receive an excellent education in the experimental sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics, but here you will supplement your education with courses in the social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Because each of you must remember our goal here, we want to further our understanding of the universe, yes, but most of all we want to help each other survive. We want humanity to continue to thrive in our little pocket of the universe!\"\n\nWhatever anxiety you were feeling about beginning this course of study is pushed to the side by the excitement you feel at the prospect of learning something new. You are looking forward to using the knowledge that you gain to one day invent something that no one in Adalia has ever seen before.",

While you know that some Adalians don’t understand the appeal of being a scientist, as it is seldom considered to be one of the most lucrative fields, you just can’t imagine a life where you don’t get the opportunity to investigate, invent, learn, and move humanity forward.\n\nAfter passing the tricky entrance examination, you enroll in The Academy for the Study and Promotion of Sciences for Humanity (or The Academy, as it is affectionately referred to by its attendees). The Academy not only certifies scientists, but also offers further advanced certifications which would enable you to one day become a medical doctor or doctor of philosophy. It is known for its exacting standards and, consequently, its high drop-out rate.\n\nWith a bit of trepidation you meet the few other prospective scientists at one of the student labs in your habitat to view the orientation video. Dr. Susan Blackwell, the last Chief Medical Officer of the Arvad, appears on the screen. She emanates the kind of calm confidence that comes from years of careful study of one’s chosen field, and her friendly smile immediately puts you at ease, reminding you of your first pediatrician, the one who alway had a silly joke to share at every appointment.\n\n\"Hello future scientists! I’m so excited to welcome you to The Academy! Not only will you receive an excellent education in the experimental sciences of biology, chemistry, and physics, but here you will supplement your education with courses in the social sciences, such as psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Because each of you must remember our goal here, we want to further our understanding of the universe, yes, but most of all we want to help each other survive. We want humanity to continue to thrive in our little pocket of the universe!\"\n\nWhatever anxiety you were feeling about beginning this course of study is pushed to the side by the excitement you feel at the prospect of learning something new. You are looking forward to using the knowledge that you gain to one day invent something that no one in Adalia has ever seen before.",

Anyone who is more interested in old court cases than flying should consider transferring to another program. I’m here to train pilots.\"\n\nThe session attendees are silent.\n\n\"Good,\" Murcheson continues. \"Speaking of ancient history, back then we had almost no EVA techs, and none of them would even really pass as a pilot today. Once we knew we would be settling a whole asteroid belt, we started training shuttle pilots as quickly as we could, and even then it wasn’t enough to keep up with all the flights we needed, bringing a whole starship down to the surface in pieces.\" \n\nShe frowns slightly.\n\n\"We still struggle to turn out enough pilots to keep our ever expanding fleets moving about in the belt. We are just about there now, where every crew that wants a pilot can get one.\n\n\"Pilots,\" she says, \"will always be in high demand. You will always have a job to do and a destination to head toward…once you graduate.\"",

You dream of one day taking the helm of an Adalian ship, and exploring the entirety of Adalia. \n\nYou enroll in Flight Academy and on the first day of your training, you and all the other aspiring pilots log into the remote learning session hosted from Adalia Prime’s education center. \n\nThe video feed shows an older woman with a pilot’s mask and the bald head favored by lifelong pilots - like mohawks and topknots, it keeps any hair away from the large radio headsets clasped over their ears while flying.\n\n\"Good morning, class,\" she begins once everyone is logged in and settled. \"I’m Flight Instructor Murcheson, and I have the distinction of being one of the longest serving pilots in all of Adalia, since I was a Specialist running EVA flights over the outer hull of the Arvad, back when the old girl still flew.\"\n\nA small whispered comment comes from someone’s live mic, but abruptly cuts off once whoever it is notices the microphone icon on their console.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Murcheson says, pausing briefly to address this. \"That’s not the only distinction I have from back in the old days, I know. Anyone who is more interested in old court cases than flying should consider transferring to another program. I’m here to train pilots.\"\n\nThe session attendees are silent.\n\n\"Good,\" Murcheson continues. \"Speaking of ancient history, back then we had almost no EVA techs, and none of them would even really pass as a pilot today. Once we knew we would be settling a whole asteroid belt, we started training shuttle pilots as quickly as we could, and even then it wasn’t enough to keep up with all the flights we needed, bringing a whole starship down to the surface in pieces.\" \n\nShe frowns slightly.\n\n\"We still struggle to turn out enough pilots to keep our ever expanding fleets moving about in the belt. We are just about there now, where every crew that wants a pilot can get one.\n\n\"Pilots,\" she says, \"will always be in high demand. You will always have a job to do and a destination to head toward…once you graduate.\"",

You dream of one day taking the helm of an Adalian ship, and exploring the entirety of Adalia. \n\nYou enroll in Flight Academy and on the first day of your training, you and all the other aspiring pilots log into the remote learning session hosted from Adalia Prime’s education center. \n\nThe video feed shows an older woman with a pilot’s mask and the bald head favored by lifelong pilots - like mohawks and topknots, it keeps any hair away from the large radio headsets clasped over their ears while flying.\n\n\"Good morning, class,\" she begins once everyone is logged in and settled. \"I’m Flight Instructor Murcheson, and I have the distinction of being one of the longest serving pilots in all of Adalia, since I was a Specialist running EVA flights over the outer hull of the Arvad, back when the old girl still flew.\"\n\nA small whispered comment comes from someone’s live mic, but abruptly cuts off once whoever it is notices the microphone icon on their console.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Murcheson says, pausing briefly to address this. \"That’s not the only distinction I have from back in the old days, I know. Anyone who is more interested in old court cases than flying should consider transferring to another program. I’m here to train pilots.\"\n\nThe session attendees are silent.\n\n\"Good,\" Murcheson continues. \"Speaking of ancient history, back then we had almost no EVA techs, and none of them would even really pass as a pilot today. Once we knew we would be settling a whole asteroid belt, we started training shuttle pilots as quickly as we could, and even then it wasn’t enough to keep up with all the flights we needed, bringing a whole starship down to the surface in pieces.\" \n\nShe frowns slightly.\n\n\"We still struggle to turn out enough pilots to keep our ever expanding fleets moving about in the belt. We are just about there now, where every crew that wants a pilot can get one.\n\n\"Pilots,\" she says, \"will always be in high demand. You will always have a job to do and a destination to head toward…once you graduate.\"",

Anyone who is more interested in old court cases than flying should consider transferring to another program. I’m here to train pilots.\"\n\nThe session attendees are silent.\n\n\"Good,\" Murcheson continues. \"Speaking of ancient history, back then we had almost no EVA techs, and none of them would even really pass as a pilot today. Once we knew we would be settling a whole asteroid belt, we started training shuttle pilots as quickly as we could, and even then it wasn’t enough to keep up with all the flights we needed, bringing a whole starship down to the surface in pieces.\" \n\nShe frowns slightly.\n\n\"We still struggle to turn out enough pilots to keep our ever expanding fleets moving about in the belt. We are just about there now, where every crew that wants a pilot can get one.\n\n\"Pilots,\" she says, \"will always be in high demand. You will always have a job to do and a destination to head toward…once you graduate.\"",
